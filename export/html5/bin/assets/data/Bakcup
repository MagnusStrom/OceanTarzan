Hey! Are you the Ninja-For-Hire we ordered?
We need your help! There's trash everywhere and we need to get it out of the ocean!
We've set up a boat at the bottom for you, but we need you to retrive the trash above it!
Ocean exploration is a little different than normal, so I'll teach you how to move.
Use A, D, Or left and right to move.
Use W to jump.
You can also use S to fall down faster.
You're a pro! Now we just need you to get the trash and get to the boat!
Jump off the platform and click and hold on the orange block to swing.
Swing into the trash to pick it up!9
Great job! Now we just need you to get to the boat!
Congratulations Ninja! You've completed the tutorial!
